            <h1 class="section-title">Economic History</h1>

            <p>Economics, social science that seeks to analyze and describe the production, distribution, and
                consumption of wealth. In the 19th century economics was the hobby of gentlemen of leisure and the
                vocation of a few academics; economists wrote about economic policy but were rarely consulted by
                legislators before decisions were made. Today there is hardly a government, international agency, or
                large commercial bank that does not have its own staff of economists. Many of the world&rsquo;s
                economists devote their time to teaching economics in colleges and universities around the world, but
                most work in various research or advisory capacities, either for themselves (in economics consulting
                firms), in industry, or in government. Still others are employed in accounting, commerce, marketing, and
                business administration; although they are trained as economists, their occupational expertise falls
                within other fields. Indeed, this can be considered &ldquo;the age of economists,&rdquo; and the demand
                for their services seems insatiable. Supply responds to that demand, and in the United States alone some
                400 institutions of higher learning grant about 900 new Ph.D.&rsquo;s in economics each year.</p>
                
                <img src="..\Images\economy_1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Economic Image">
                <p>No one has ever succeeded in neatly defining the scope of economics. Many have agreed with
                    Alfred Marshall, a leading 19th-century English economist, that economics is &ldquo;a study of mankind
                    in the ordinary business of life; it examines that part of individual and social action which is most
                    closely connected with the attainment, and with the use of the material requisites of
                wellbeing&rdquo;&mdash;ignoring the fact that sociologists, psychologists, and anthropologists
                frequently study exactly the same phenomena. In the 20th century, English economist Lionel Robbins
                defined economics as &ldquo;the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between (given)
                ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.&rdquo; In other words, Robbins said that economics is
                the science of economizing. While his definition captures one of the striking characteristics of the
                economist&rsquo;s way of thinking, it is at once too wide (because it would include in economics the
                game of chess) and too narrow (because it would exclude the study of the national income or the price
                level). Perhaps the only foolproof definition is that attributed to Canadian-born economist Jacob Viner:
                economics is what economists do.</p>

            <p>Difficult as it may be to define economics, it is not difficult to indicate the sorts of questions that
                concern economists. Among other things, they seek to analyze the forces determining prices&mdash;not
                only the prices of goods and services but the prices of the resources used to produce them. This
                involves the discovery of two key elements: what governs the way in which human labour, machines, and
                land are combined in production and how buyers and sellers are brought together in a functioning market.
                Because prices of the various things must be interrelated, economists therefore ask how such a
                &ldquo;price system&rdquo; or &ldquo;market mechanism&rdquo; hangs together and what conditions are
                necessary for its survival.</p>
                
                <p>These questions are representative of microeconomics, the part of economics that deals with the behaviour
                    of individual entities such as consumers, business firms, traders, and farmers. The other major branch
                of economics is macroeconomics, which focuses attention on aggregates such as the level of income in the
                whole economy, the volume of total employment, the flow of total investment, and so forth. Here
                economists are concerned with the forces determining the income of a country or the level of total
                investment, and they seek to learn why full employment is so rarely attained and what public policies
                might help a country achieve higher employment or greater price stability.</p>
                
                <img src="..\Images\Economy_image.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Economic Image">
            <p>But these examples still do not exhaust the range of problems that economists consider. There is also the
                important field of development economics, which examines the attitudes and institutions supporting the
                process of economic development in poor countries as well as those capable of self-sustained economic
                growth (for example, development economics was at the heart of the Marshall Plan). In this field the
                economist is concerned with the extent to which the factors affecting economic development can be
                manipulated by public policy.</p>

            <p>Cutting across these major divisions in economics are the specialized fields of public finance, money and
                banking, international trade, labour economics, agricultural economics, industrial organization, and
                others. Economists are frequently consulted to assess the effects of governmental measures such as
                taxation, minimum-wage laws, rent controls, tariffs, changes in interest rates, changes in government
                budgets, and so on.</p>

            <p>The effective birth of economics as a separate discipline may be
                traced to the year 1776, when the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith published An Inquiry into the Nature
                and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. There was, of course, economics before Smith: the Greeks made
                significant contributions, as did the medieval scholastics, and from the 15th to the 18th century an
                enormous amount of pamphlet literature discussed and developed the implications of economic nationalism
                (a body of thought now known as mercantilism). It was Smith, however, who wrote the first full-scale
                treatise on economics and, by his magisterial influence, founded what later generations were to call the
                &ldquo;English school of classical political economy,&rdquo; known today as classical economics.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Glossary of Terms</h2>

            <p><strong> Microeconomics: </strong>The branch of economics that analyzes the behavior and decision-making
                of individual
                entities, such as consumers, businesses, and industries. It focuses on how these entities interact
                within markets to determine prices, supply, and demand.</p>

            <p><strong> Macroeconomics: </strong>A major branch of economics that examines the economy as a whole,
                focusing on aggregate
                indicators such as national income, total employment, inflation, and overall economic growth.
                Macroeconomics seeks to understand the larger economic forces at play and the policies that can
                influence them.</p>

            <p><strong> Development Economics:</strong> A field of economics that studies the economic aspects of the
                development process
                in low-income countries. It examines factors affecting economic growth, poverty alleviation, and the
                effectiveness of public policies aimed at fostering self-sustained economic progress.</p>

            <p><strong> Market Mechanism:</strong> The process through which buyers and sellers interact to determine
                prices and allocate
                resources in an economy. The market mechanism relies on supply and demand dynamics to establish
                equilibrium prices, guiding the distribution of goods and services.</p>

            <p><strong> Public Finance:</strong> The study of government revenue and expenditure and its impact on the
                economy. This field
                analyzes how government policies, such as taxation and spending, affect economic stability, resource
                allocation, and overall welfare.</p>
