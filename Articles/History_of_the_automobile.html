            <h3>The History of the Automobile</h3>
            <p>The history of the automobile is a captivating journey that reflects the evolution of technology,
                society, and human ingenuity. From the earliest steam-powered vehicles to the advanced electric and
                autonomous cars of today, the automobile has transformed the way we live, work, and travel. This
                detailed article delves into the milestones and key developments in the history of the automobile.</p>
            <h4>Early Innovations and Steam-Powered Vehicles</h4>
            <p>The concept of a self-propelled vehicle dates back to the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Early
                innovators experimented with steam-powered engines to create vehicles that could move without the need
                for animal or human power.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Ferdinand Verbiest (1672)</strong>: A Flemish Jesuit missionary and scientist, Verbiest
                        is credited with designing a small, steam-powered vehicle as a toy for the Chinese Emperor
                        Kangxi. Although it was not intended for transportation, Verbiest's invention demonstrated the
                        potential of steam power for vehicle propulsion.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot (1769)</strong>: A French engineer and inventor, Cugnot built one
                        of the first full-scale, self-propelled mechanical vehicles. His steam-powered tricycle, known
                        as the "Fardier &agrave; vapeur," was designed for military use to haul artillery. Despite its
                        limited success and practical challenges, Cugnot's invention is often considered a precursor to
                        modern automobiles.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Richard Trevithick (1801)</strong>: An English engineer and inventor, Trevithick built a
                        steam-powered road vehicle called the "Puffing Devil." It is considered the first demonstration
                        of a steam-powered vehicle capable of carrying passengers. While Trevithick's vehicle faced
                        challenges with steam pressure and safety, it laid the groundwork for future developments.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>The Birth of the Internal Combustion Engine</h4>
            <img src="..\Images\Automobile1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Automobile Image">
            <p>The internal combustion engine (ICE) revolutionized the automobile industry by providing a more efficient
                and practical means of propulsion. Several key inventors and engineers made significant contributions to
                the development of the ICE.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>&Eacute;tienne Lenoir (1859)</strong>: A Belgian engineer, Lenoir developed the first
                        commercially successful internal combustion engine. His gas-powered engine, known as the "Lenoir
                        Gas Engine," was used to power a small vehicle. Lenoir's invention marked a significant step
                        toward the practical application of internal combustion technology.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Nikolaus Otto (1876)</strong>: A German engineer, Otto developed the four-stroke internal
                        combustion engine, also known as the "Otto Cycle." This engine, which completed four distinct
                        strokes (intake, compression, power, and exhaust), became the foundation for modern gasoline
                        engines. Otto's engine design greatly improved efficiency and reliability.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach (1885)</strong>: German engineers and inventors,
                        Daimler and Maybach built the first high-speed, gasoline-powered internal combustion engine.
                        They installed their engine in a two-wheeled vehicle, creating one of the first motorcycles.
                        Daimler and Maybach's innovations laid the groundwork for the development of practical
                        automobiles.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>The First Automobiles</h4>
            <img src="..\Images\Automobile2.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Automobile Image">
            <p>The late 19th century saw the emergence of the first true automobiles, powered by internal combustion
                engines. These early vehicles were the precursors to the modern car.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Karl Benz (1886)</strong>: A German engineer, Karl Benz is often credited with inventing
                        the first true automobile. His three-wheeled vehicle, known as the "Benz Patent-Motorwagen," was
                        powered by a single-cylinder gasoline engine. Benz's vehicle featured many innovative
                        components, including a carburetor, ignition system, and cooling system. The Benz
                        Patent-Motorwagen is widely regarded as the world's first production automobile.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach (1886)</strong>: In addition to their earlier work,
                        Daimler and Maybach built one of the first four-wheeled automobiles. Their vehicle, known as the
                        "Daimler Motor Carriage," featured a high-speed gasoline engine and a transmission system.
                        Daimler and Maybach's contributions were instrumental in advancing automotive technology.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Emil Jellinek and Mercedes (1901)</strong>: An Austrian businessman, Jellinek partnered
                        with Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft (DMG) to create a new line of automobiles. The result was the
                        "Mercedes 35 HP," named after Jellinek's daughter, Mercedes. This vehicle, designed by Wilhelm
                        Maybach, featured a powerful engine, a lightweight chassis, and advanced aerodynamics. The
                        Mercedes 35 HP is considered one of the first modern automobiles and set new standards for
                        performance and design.</p>

            <h4>The Rise of the Automobile Industry</h4>
            <img src="..\Images\Automobile3.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Automobile Image">
            <p>The early 20th century marked the rapid growth of the automobile industry, driven by mass production
                techniques and increasing demand for personal transportation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Henry Ford (1908)</strong>: An American industrialist, Henry Ford revolutionized the
                        automobile industry with the introduction of the Model T. The Model T was affordable, reliable,
                        and easy to maintain, making it accessible to a wide range of consumers. Ford's use of assembly
                        line production techniques greatly increased efficiency and reduced costs. The Model T's success
                        transformed the automobile from a luxury item into a mass-market product.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>General Motors (1908)</strong>: Founded by William C. Durant, General Motors (GM) became
                        one of the largest and most influential automobile manufacturers in the world. GM's strategy of
                        acquiring and consolidating multiple car brands, including Chevrolet, Buick, and Cadillac,
                        allowed it to offer a diverse range of vehicles to different market segments. GM's innovations
                        in marketing, financing, and product development played a key role in shaping the industry.</p>
