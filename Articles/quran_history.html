            <p>The Holy Qur'an, read by over 1 billion people worldwide. It is the book that is at the center of the
                religion of Islam. From it is derived theology, spirituality, divine wisdom, lessons from history and so
                much more. Today it is read every day by Muslims all over the world and holds a special place in every
                Muslim household.</p>

            <p>We know that the Holy Qur'an is the divine word of God, delivered directly to the Holy Prophet Muhammad,
                Peace Be Upon Him. But how exactly did this work? How did that which was revealed to the Holy Prophet
                become the written word that we read today? And is the Qur'an that we hold in our hands today the exact
                same Qur'an held by the hands of the early Muslims? In this documentary we shall explore the history of
                the Qur'an and how the divine words of Allah reached us today.</p>

            <p>One of the oldest debates surrounding the Holy Qur'an is the nature of its existence. Before the first
                verses were revealed to the Holy Prophet, did the Holy Qur'an exist and if so, in what form?</p>

            <p>The Qur'an Al-Karim is a manuscript that Rasul Allah salla Allahu alayhi wa alihi wa sallam publicized.
                Various theological schools of thought came to discuss the essence and origin of said manuscript, the
                Qur'an. Between them, the Mu'tazila, the 'Asharite, the Asha'ira. Many have argued that the Qur'an is
                pre eternal or in the theological discussion Qadeem. It exists coexisting alongside Allah Sunbhana wa
                Ta'ala. However, in the school of Ahl ul-Bayt, in addition to the Sunni theological school, the
                Mu'tazila, the Qur'an is created as is everything else with the exception of Allah Sunbhana wa Ta'ala.
            </p>
            <img src="..\Images\Holy_Quran_1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Holy_Quran Image">
            <p>But the Qur'an was destined for revelation that we can confirm. Allah has destined that this book would
                be revealed to the heart of the Holy Prophet of Islam, through the various mediums, be them dreams,
                Gabriel, divine inspiration. This was planned and this was destined, but it did not exist before the
                first of the verses came down to the Holy Prophet of Islam.</p>

            <p>The Abbasid government propagated for the idea that the Qur'an was never created. It always existed with
                God. The Imams of Ahl ul-Bayt clarified their position. They did not want to be involved in this
                discussion because it was heavily being politicized. But the Imams made it very clear that everything
                besides Allah is created, hinting that the Holy Qur'an is the Word of God, it's not God, it's the word
                of God and hence it is the creation of the Almighty God.</p>

            <p>So we know that the Holy Qur'an is created. However, did the Holy Qur'an exist before Revelation?
                Scholars are split into two groups here. One group of scholars believe that the Holy Qur'an did exist
                before Revelation. It existed in a different realm. The Holy Qur'an hints at those different realms. For
                instance, you have the preserved tablet, the &quot;Lawh al-Mahfuz&quot;. The Holy Qur'an existed in the
                preserved tablet, before officially being revealed to Prophet Muhammad salla Allahu alayhi wa alih.</p>

            <p>This indicates that it did exist. The second group of scholars states that the Holy Qur'an was revealed
                when the Prophet salla Allahu alayhi wa alih, was at age 40. Before that there was no existence to this
                verbal dimension of the Qur'an. The Word of God existed. It was in a preserved tablet, but Allah Subhana
                wa Ta'ala had not initiated the descension of the Holy Qur'an to this world. That only happened when the
                Prophet was in the cave and he received official revelation.</p>
            <img src="..\Images\Holy_Quran_2.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Holy_Quran Image">
            <p>The story of the Divine Book begins in the cave of Hira where the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him, would
                go to meditate and worship. It was here that the first verses of the Holy Qur'an were revealed unto him
                saying- Read In the name of your Lord. Rasul Allah salla Allahu alayhi wa alihi wa sallam would ascend
                Jabal an-Nur and he would enter that cave known as Ghar Hira. Inside he would meditate and reflect. He
                would do this for 20 years. When he became 20 years old. Up until his 40th birthday or that 40th year,
                the Holy Prophet of Islam would seek time to reflect for two months straight, during the month of Rajab.
            </p>

            <p>One of these meditation sessions, the Holy Prophet of Islam was received by the Arcangel Gabriel.
                Jibra'il announced to the Holy Prophet that the circumstances are ripe. You must commence your mission,
                therefore commence it with the following- Read in the name of your Lord who has created you. And this
                was the very first verse revealed to man and woman kind from what would be the complete Qur'an Al-Karim.
            </p>

            <p>Iqra bismi Rabbika alladhee khalaq (96:1). Khalaqa al-insaana min 'alaq (96:2). Iqra wa Rabbuka al-Akram
                (96:3). Alladhee 'allama bi 'l-qalam (96:4). 'Allama al-insaana ma lam y'alam (96:5).</p>

            <p>In the Shii' traditions it was revealed on the Maba'th of the Prophet which is the 27th of Rajab.
                According to Sunni traditions it was revealed during the month of Ramadan. They refer to &quot;Inna
                anzalnahu fi Laylati Al-Qadr (97:1). We believe that the beginning of the revelation of the Qur'an was
                revealed on the day of the Maba'th, the 27th of Rajab upon Rasul Allah salla Allahu alayhi wa alih, and
                that was when the first verses of Surat Iqra... (96:1) were revealed. That was the beginning of the 23
                year period of Qur'anic revelation because the Qur'an was revealed upon the Prophet over an era of 23
                years, and the first verses that were revealed upon the Prophet were those verses, the first five verses
                of Surat Iqra.</p>
            <img src="..\Images\Holy_Quran_3.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Holy_Quran Image">
            <p>There were two different types of revelations of the Qur'an. There is Inzal, a sudden revelation, and
                there is Tanzil, gradual revelation. The Tanzil, the gradual revelation, as we know it began from the
                time Rasul Allah salla Allahu alayhi wa alih, was in the cave, Surat Iqra was revealed all the way until
                the last verses that were revealed upon Rasul Allah salla Allahu alayhi wa alih. That was over a span of
                23 years. That was Tanzil, that was gradual revelation that was revealed upon Rasul Allah salla Allahu
                alayhi wa alihi wa sallam. We believe that the gradual revelation began on the day of the Mabath that
                began on the 27th of Rajab according to our narrations from the Imams of the Ahl ul-Bayt alayhum
                as-salam.</p>

            <p>As for the Inzal, the sudden revelation of the Qur'an, yes, we believe that the Inzal, the sudden
                revelation of the Qur'an every year that would happen, that would take place upon the heart of Rasul
                Allah salla Allahu alayhi wa alih, every year on Laylat ul-Qadr. On Laylat ul-Qadr, there was a full
                sudden revelation of the whole Qur'an that would be revealed upon the heart of Rasul Allah.</p>

            <p>We know that the Holy Prophet received revelation from Allah, Subhana wa Ta'ala, and this is how the
                Qur'an found its way to us. But how exactly did this revelation work? Were there different forms of
                revelation? And how did the Holy Prophet react to revelation?</p>

            <p>The first time the revelation came down upon the Prophet was when the Archangel Jibra'il came down in his
                angelic form upon Raul Allah salla Allahu alayhi wa alih, and the angelic form of Jibra'il was this
                grand creation. He came down upon the Prophet and he tells the Prophet, Iqra, read in the name of your
                Lord, Iqra bismi Rabbika alladhee khalaq (96:1). And Rasul Allah salla Allahu alayhi wa alih, began to
                recite the Qur'an after Jibra'il.</p>

            <p>But the Wahi, the revelation of the Qur'an came down in different ways. Sometimes Jibra'il would come
                down in his angelic form, he would come down and he would deliver the verses of the Qur'an to Rasul
                Allah salla Allahu alayhi wa alih. In another time, the Qur'an would be revealed directly upon the heart
                of Rasul Allah salla Allahu alayhi wa alih, without an intermediary. This was some type of revelation.
                And a third type of revelation was through a dream, or through hearing a sound, not through Jibra'il and
                not through a direct revelation.</p>

            <p>Muslims they narrate that when the Qur'an would be revealed, when the Wahi would be revealed upon the
                Prophet, they would see that the appearance of the Prophet would change. For example, it is narrated
                that on a cold night, when the revelation would reveal upon Rasul Allah salla Allahu alayhi wa alih,
                they would see him start to shiver and they would see him sweating because of the magnitude of the
                verses that are revealed onto his heart.</p>
            <img src="..\Images\Holy_Quran_4.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Holy_Quran Image">
            <p>And Allah Subhana wa Ta'ala, when Allah speaks about the Qur'an, Allah says: &quot;Law anzalna hadha
                al-Qur'ana 'ala jabilil, la raytahoo khashi'an mutasaddi'an min khashiyati Allah&quot; (59:21). If this
                Qur'an were to be revealed on a mountain, you would see that the mountain would crumble. The only one,
                the only heart that was able to accept the revelation of the Qur'an was the heart of Rasul Allah salla
                Allahu alayhi wa alih.</p>

            <p>Sometimes Jibra'il would come and he would not necessarily speak the words of the Qur'an for the Prophet
                to hear them, he would cast them directly to his heart. &quot;Nazala bihi ar-Ruhu al-Amin&quot;
                (26:193), &quot;'ala qalbik&quot; (26:194), as the Qur'an states. ar-Ruhu al-Amin, the trusted spirit,
                brought down the Qur'an on your heart. He's not speaking the verses to the Prophet, he is directly
                communicating them to his heart. So the Prophet salla Allahu alayhi wa alihi wa sallam feels the
                meanings of the verses, the presence of the verses in his mind and his heart.</p>

            <p>&quot;Bismi-Llah, Al-Rahmani, Al-Rahim&quot;. &quot;Ya ayyuha al-Insanu ma gharraka bi Rabbika
                al-Kareem&quot; (82:6). &quot;Alladhee khalaqaka fa sawwaka fa 'adalak&quot; (82:7).</p>

            <p>One of the most fascinating questions surrounding the Holy Qur'an is surrounding its current form as a
                book. While it's obvious that today the Holy Qur'an is a book that Muslims all around the world read,
                during the Holy time of the Prophet, Arabs relied on an oral culture. Therefore, the Holy Qur'an was
                mostly spoken and recited from memory, not read. So was the Qur'an always intended to be a book? And in
                what form did it exist, during the time of the Holy Prophet?</p>

            <p>Most companions had an understanding that this was going to be a book. First of all, the Holy Qur'an
                refers to the Qur'an as the Kitab in a number of verses: &quot;Dhalika al-Kitab la raiba fih&quot;
                (2:2). That is the book, there is no doubt in it. In Arabic, Kitab means book. When you say to a native
                Arabic speaker Kitab, what comes to mind is a book that has pages and has a cover. So many companions
                knew that this is a Kitab, this is a book and it will be one day in book format. Secondly, we have
                narrations from the Prophet salla Allahu alayhi wa alih, such as Hadith ath-Thaqlayn and other Hadiths,
                in which the Prophet would refer to the Qur'an as a book where you could refer to. Yes, you have the
                spiritual dimension of the Qur'an, but companions understood it also in a physical sense. There is a
                tangible Qur'an that you can refer to.</p>
            <p>As verses gradually began to descend over a period of two decades, the Qur'an was gradually compiled
                together, inscribed by various companions of the Holy Prophet including Imam Ali, alayhi as-salam.</p>

            <p>We believe that Rasul Allah salla Allahu alayhi wa alih, by the time he had passed away, the Qur'an had
                all been written down. We, the Shi'a, belief is that the Qur'an had been written down but it was written
                down not in a book form that we have right now. It was written down on pieces of leather, pieces of
                skin, pieces of wood, pieces of parchment and it was gathered in the house of Rasul Allah salla Allahu
                alayhi wa alih.</p>
            <img src="..\Images\Holy_Quran_5.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Holy_Quran Image">

            <p>As the Holy Qur'an would be revealed, there were a number of companions who would write and scribe the
                holy Qur'an. The foremost of them is Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib, alayhi as-salam. Not a single verse was
                revealed except that Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib, alayhi as-salam, wrote the verse. Not only did he write the
                verse, he wrote the context behind the verse, the reason for revelation, the Tafsir and the Ta'wil. So
                Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib, alayhi as-salam, we know, had the complete Qur'an written by his blessed hands,
                throughout the period of 20 or 23 years as the Holy Qur'an was being revealed.</p>

            <p>Imam Ali, alayhi as-salam, himself mentions and reports: &quot;ma min ayatin fi Kitabi Allah, illa
                imlawuhu Rasul Allah wa khattuhu bi yadihi&quot;. There is not a verse from the Book of Allah, Subhana
                wa Ta'ala, except that it was recited by Rasul Allah and written by my hand.</p>

            <p>Then you have other companions who also participated in the practice of writing the Qur'an. One of them
                was Zayd Ibn Thabit. He also tried to write many parts of the Qur'an. We don't know if he wrote the
                entire Qur'an but he wrote a significant portion of the Qur'an. It's not clear to us when we look at
                historical reports, whether he wrote the entire Qur'an, or maybe many chapters. Other names that have
                been mentioned in our Hadith sources is 'Ubay Ibn Ka'ab. In fact, companions sometimes would refer to
                him, to make sure that they have parts of the Qur'an written correctly. He was considered an expert on
                the revelation of the Qur'an and writing the Qur'an.</p>

            <p>Ma'ad Ibn Jabal is also mentioned as being one of the scribes of the Qur'an. Abu Zayd, one of the uncles
                of Anas Ibn Malik. He has also been mentioned. Abdullah ibn 'Umar, he has also been mentioned as one of
                the writers of the Qur'an. They would hear the Qur'an orally, verbally from the Prophet and then they
                had sheets of paper. Usually in that era the sheets of paper were made from deer skin. And so you will
                find many of the pages of the Qur'an that have been survived through history to be on deer skin.</p>

            <p>When the Holy Prophet salla Allahu alayhi wa alih, was martyred and he departed this physical life, we
                have many clues and reports that a physical Qur'an that was complete, existed. First of all Imam Ali ibn
                Abi Talib alayhi as-salam, he had written all parts of the Qur'an. Zayd Ibn Thabit had written parts of
                the Qur'an. According to An-Nisa'i, in a Hadith which is Sahih according to Sunni standards, Nisa'i
                narrates one Hadith from Abdullah ibn 'Umar in which he states, I had gathered the Qur'an and I would
                complete all of it in one night, according to Nisa'i.</p>
            <img src="..\Images\Holy_Quran_6.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Holy_Quran Image">
            <p>This is a clue or piece of evidence that some scholars have indicated, have used, to indicate that the
                Qur'an did exist at the time of the Prophet salla Allahu alayhi wa alih, in a book format. There are
                some other narrations that indicate there was a physical copy in the masjid of the Prophet salla Allahu
                alayhi wa alih, that any companion could refer to. They would keep it by the pulpit of the Prophet, and
                you could read parts of the Qur'an. As new revelation would descend, new pages would be added. There
                were scattered pages. It was not organized into a complete book with two organized covers. And back
                then, how would they bind the pages? It was through pieces of thread.</p>

            <p>That did not exist at the time of the Prophet salla Allahu alayhi wa alih. It was basically scattered
                pages and they were probably not in a particular sequence as well. And we even have narrations that
                indicate the Prophet salla Allahu alayhi wa alih, would tell his companions where to put certain verses.
                If you don't have a book that's before you where is the Prophet telling them to put these verses and to
                number them even?</p>

            <p>After the death of Rasul Allah, salla Allahu alayhi wa alih, there were two simultaneous gatherings of
                the Qur'an, compilations of the Qur'an. One was Amir Al-Mu'minin Ali ibn Abi Talib, alayhi as-salam. He
                sat in his home and he began to compile the Qur'an immediately after the death of Rasul Allah salla
                Allahu alayhi wa alih. And this is why weeks or months later when they asked Imam Ali, why were you late
                in giving Bayat to Abu Bakr? What was the excuse of Amir Al-Mu'minin? He tells them I was gathering the
                Qur'an, as Rasul Allah salla Allahu alayhi wa alih, ordered me to do so.</p>

            <p>And he did compile the Qur'an, not only did he have the verses of the Qur'an and the Surahs of the Qur'an
                but he had the Tafsir, the commentary of every verse in the Qur'an, it was written in that book. And
                Amir Al-Mu'minin, he came and he brought it to the Muslims, he tells them: this is the Qur'an, and the
                Hadith says, he brought &quot;'ala himly ba'hir? he brought it carrying it on a camel. How could a book
                be carried on a camel? So we understand from this that this was not just the Qur'an but this was the
                commentary of the Qur'an from the words of Amir Al-Mu'minin. His exegesis, his Tafsir, was added
                alongside the verses of the Qur'an and he brought it to them. They tell him: &quot;la hajata lana bi
                Qur'anik&quot;, we don't need this Qur'an. So Amir Al-Mu'minin tells them, then you will not see it. And
                we believe that this book will be revealed with Imam Mahdi Al-Muntadhar when he arises.</p>
            <img src="..\Images\Holy_Quran_7.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Holy_Quran Image">
            <p>This Qur'an, unfortunately, is not accessible, and society missed its opportunity. We could have learned
                so much with it. A very famous non Shi'i scholar, Ibn Sirin mentions: had we kept the Mus-haf of Ali, la
                wajadu fihi al-'Ilm, we would have noticed and found within it, a plentiful amount of knowledge and
                wisdom. But this book and this Qur'an with its Tafsir, with its beautiful order, is in the possession of
                the Imam of our time and we ask Allah to allow us access to the Imam and through the Imam, this Qur'an
                that was written by the blessed hands of Amir Al-Mu'minin himself.</p>

            <p>Another compilation of the Qur'an was the compilation that took place by the order of Abu Bakr. And that
                was not immediately after the death of the Prophet. Because the Muslims, they saw that there was no need
                to write down the Qur'an. As we said, it was an oral culture. They didn't see the need, the necessity to
                write down the Qur'an. But what happened was there was a battle and this was during the apostasy wars of
                Abu Bakr. There were some groups of people that refused to accept Abu Bakr as a legitimate leader. And
                there was another group of people that left the religion of Islam. Abu Bakr, he waged a war against all
                of them, those who left the religion of Islam and those who refused to accept him as the khalifah. And
                they called them the Apostasy Wars when in fact the reality is that not many of them were apostates, not
                many of them left the religion of Islam. Some of them like Malik Ibn Nowera, they just had their own
                problems with Abu Bakr. They did not agree to Abu Bakr being a leader.</p>

                <p>So in these wars, they say that, many of the qurra' al-Qur'an, many of those people who had memorized
                    the
                    Qur'an, they were killed in those wars. One of the battles by the name of the battle of Yamama, they
                    say
                    tens of the qurra' al-Qur'an, of those who had memorized the Qur'an, they were killed in the battle.
                    So
                    here the Muslims, they saw an urgency. The same that happened to Christianity and Judaism where
                    their
                    books got distorted after the prophets, could happen to the Qur'an. So the Muslims, they saw an
                    urgency
                    to write down the Qur'an.</p>

                <p>And here Abu Bakr, he ordered Zayd Ibn Thabit. Zayd Ibn Thabit, he becomes the man who is charged
                    with
                    and given the responsibility of scribing and writing down the Qur'an. He would sit in the Masjid and
                    he
                    would write down the Qur'an and the Muslims, they would come, if any of them had heard a verse, they
                    would come and they would have to bring two witnesses to say whether they heard this verse from
                    Rasul
                    Allah salla Allahu alayhi wa alih, or they did not. Under the leadership of Zayd Ibn Thabit, the
                    whole
                    Qur'an was gathered.</p>
                <img src="..\Images\Holy_Quran_8.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Holy_Quran Image">
                <p>Once that Qur'an was gathered, the Muslims did not even read from it, because as we mentioned, there
                    was
                    no reliance on reading the Qur'an. It was an oral culture. So it was left in the house of Abu Bakr.
                    And
                    then, after the death of Abu Bakr it went with 'Umar, and then after the death of 'Umar it remained
                    with
                    Hafsa, Hafsa the daughter of 'Umar and the wife of the Prophet salla Allahu alayhi wa alih, it
                    remained
                    with her. Then you have during the time of Uthman, they called for that Qur'an to be brought out
                    once
                    again, to compare it with the Qur'an that was being written, the Qur'an that was being compiled
                    during
                    the time of Uthman.</p>

                <p>The Qur'an we hold in our hands today is generally referred to as the Uthmani Qur'an. This is mostly
                    due
                    to the fact that it was a Codex that was put together during the caliphate of Uthman Ibn Affan. What
                    was
                    this Codex? And how did it differ, if at all, from other manuscripts of the time?</p>

                <p>Only 50 years after the death of the Prophet, you have more non-Arab Muslims becoming Muslims than
                    the
                    Arab Muslims. So Islam began to grow exponentially and it began to grow very quickly. During the
                    time of
                    Uthman there were some wars that were taking place, and there was an expansionist movement going on,
                    where the Muslims were waging wars against Azerbaijan and areas of Turkey, current day Turkey. Now
                    you
                    have many Muslims who are non Arab and the Qur'an was being recited in various dialects. You have
                    the
                    dialect of the Arabs who are in Hijaz, for example, the dialect of the Arabs who are in Kufa, the
                    dialect of the Arabs who are in Damascus. Sometimes some of the meanings were being changed, so this
                    caused a problem, and now you're going to have many Non-Arab Muslims joining which they cannot rely
                    on
                    an oral tradition because their Arabic is not their original language.</p>

                <p>One of the companions of the Prophet, salla Allahu alayhi wa alih, who was also a student of Imam Ali
                    alayhi as-salam, one of the followers of Imam Ali, by the name of Hudhaifa Ibn Yaman, he was
                    participating in some battles. When he realized that Muslims were pronouncing the Qur'an
                    differently.
                </p>

                <p>He noticed that many Muslims in these far lands were reading the Qur'an differently. It is narrated
                    and
                    reported that a man read in the chapter of Al-Baqara, &quot;La rayba fih&quot; (2:2), because there
                    were
                    no dots or ayacritics or diacritics rather, they read it as &quot;La zaita fi&quot;, because they
                    couldn't tell. And various accents and readings and lexical understandings on the morphology was
                    simply
                    changing. He sent a letter to Uthman, the Khalifa, and requested &quot;Idrak Ummat Muhammad&quot;,
                    help
                    and save the Ummah of Muhammad, for they are changing the reading of the Qur'an. Please save this
                    before
                    it turns into a similar situation we saw with the Jews and the Christians.</p>
                <img src="..\Images\Holy_Quran_9.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Holy_Quran Image">
                <p>So Uthman gathers companions amongst them Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib, alayhi as-salam. He informs them of
                    the
                    concern that Hudhaifa Ibn Yaman had and they come to the agreement that the Qur'an should be
                    unified. So
                    Uthman communicates with his governors in other villages, and other cities, and he summons all
                    existing
                    copies of the Qur'an. Once he summons all those copies of the Qur'an, he destroys them. Some
                    narrations
                    indicate he burned them, and he had one standard version, which was approved by the companions, that
                    was
                    replicated and copied, and sent to these other cities and villages. So Uthman did unify the Codex,
                    yes,
                    the standard way of writing the Holy Qur'an. But this was by consulting other companions. This was
                    by
                    the suggestion of the student of Imam Ali, alayhi as-salam. And in our narrations, Imam Ali ibn Abi
                    Talib, alayhi as-salam, approved of this effort.</p>

                <p>Imam Ali read this version of the Holy Qur'an, and he confirmed and gave the green light to it: it's
                    fine, so long as no verses were tampered and changed with. However, the difference between this
                    manuscript that is commonly known as Mus-haf 'Uthman and the manuscript that Rasul Allah presented
                    to
                    both man and woman kind, is that the order of the chapters have been rearranged. The &quot;as-saba'a
                    at-tiwal&quot; seven large chapters are in the beginning. Then &quot;al-mi'yun&quot;, the chapters
                    that
                    have roughly 100 verses, are in the middle. Then the &quot;qisar&quot;, the smaller chapters, are
                    later
                    on towards the end. They organize this for convenient purposes. And al-Fatiha being the first
                    chapter as
                    well, this was for the sake of convenience.</p>

                <p>However, Imam Ali, said there is no harm in this so long as the content has not been changed. Imam
                    Ali
                    ibn Abi Talib, however, had with him the Qur'an that Rasul Allah ordered him to compile. What
                    distinguishes the Qur'an that he codified under the orders of Rasul Allah, is that it was organized
                    based on the Tanzil and the order chronologically when it was revealed. So 'Alaq [96] would have
                    been
                    likely the first chapter. And this is beneficial because it gives you history and Sirah. The Qur'an
                    becomes a historic book of the life of the Prophet. This was his first chapter. This would have been
                    his
                    last, Al-Ma'ida [5], for example.</p>

                <p>The order that we have right now. There are some scholars that say the Prophet, he tells the Muslims,
                    place this Surah after this Surah and place this Surah after this Surah. So he would tell them, this
                    is
                    according to some scholars. We know for sure, we are certain that the order of the actual verses is
                    where the Prophet ordered for them to be. But the actual Surah, some say this just happened by
                    chance,
                    some Muslims, they started putting one here and one there. But another group of Muslims, they say
                    that
                    no, even the order of the Surahs, this was by the order of Rasul Allah salla Allahu alayhi wa alih.
                </p>
                <img src="..\Images\Holy_Quran_1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Holy_Quran Image">
                <p>Some scholars, upon analyzing the sequence of the chapters, they find a miraculous connection between
                    how
                    one chapter ends and how another one starts. This even gives them more confidence, that the current
                    sequence we know today was assigned by the Prophet salla Allahu alayhi wa alih. Is there a consensus
                    on
                    this? A unanimous position? No. There are many scholars, especially from the other schools of
                    thought,
                    who believe that the companions are the ones who arranged the current sequence of the Qur'an. It was
                    not
                    determined when the Prophet salla Allahu alayhi wa alih was alive. My take on that is, the Qur'an is
                    the
                    greatest project of the Prophet, and every aspect of the Qur'an is mesmerizing, impeccable and
                    miraculous. I find it hard to believe that the Prophet salla Allahu alayhi wa alih, would give you
                    this
                    miraculous book without telling you what the sequence is.</p>

                <p>The discussion surrounding Tahrif of the Qur'an, that is distortions and changes to the Holy Book, is
                    simultaneously one of the most controversial and most fascinating discourses in Islam. Therefore, we
                    ask
                    the question, has the Qur'an been changed? And is the Qur'an we have, the exact same Qur'an as was
                    in
                    the hands of the Holy Prophet?</p>

                <p>We believe that the Qur'an has been preserved, and Allah, Allah Subhana wa Ta'ala, says in the Qur'an
                    that: &quot;We have revealed this Qur'an upon you and We shall preserve it&quot; (15:9). &quot;wa
                    inna
                    lahu la hafidhoon&quot;, It shall be preserved. There is a consensus amongst Muslim scholars and the
                    all
                    Muslim, Sunni and Shi'a, that the Qur'an that we have right now, this is the Qur'an that was
                    revealed
                    upon Rasul Allah, salla Allahu alayhi wa alih. The narrations that would suggest otherwise, either
                    we
                    reject those narrations, or we have to understand them differently.</p>

                <p>For example, you might see an Usul Al-Kafi, you might see a Hadith from Imam as-Sadiq for example, he
                    says: this verse was revealed in such and such way, and he recites it in a way that is different
                    from
                    the way that it is in the Qur'an. We understand that this is the Tafsir of the Imam. We understand
                    that
                    this is the exegesis of the Imam. The Qur'an was being recited publicly in the mosques, in Kufa, in
                    Damascus, in Basra, in Cairo, it was being recited, and if someone were to change the Qur'an, right
                    away
                    the Muslims would notice and it would cause an outcry.</p>

                <p>Today when you look at Sunni books of Hadith you will find tens of Hadiths, of narrations, in their
                    authentic books, that indicate verses in the Qur'an went missing. Tafsir Al-Qurtubi and Tafsir
                    Adh-Dhurr
                    al-Manthur which are Sunni books of Tafsir. They have narrated Hadiths which claim that Surat
                    al-Ahzab,
                    chapter 33 of the Qur'an, was 200 verses at the time of the Prophet, but then later some verses were
                    omitted. Musnad Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, and a number of other sources indicate that Surat Al-Ahzab [33]
                    was
                    almost the size of Surat Al-Baqara [2] which is the longest chapter in the Holy Qur'an. So there are
                    claims in the Sunni Hadiths that at the time of the Prophet salla Allahu alayhi wa alih, chapter 33,
                    Surat Al-Ahzaab was as big as Surat Al-Baqara. Obviously that's not the case today. So these
                    narrations
                    are indicating many verses went missing.</p>
                <img src="..\Images\Holy_Quran_3.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Holy_Quran Image">
                <p>Another example of Tahrif in Sunni hadith sources is one that is mentioned by Sahih Muslim. This
                    narration is attributed to Abu Musa Al -Ashari. Abu Musa Al-Ashari claims according to this
                    narration
                    that there was a chapter in the Qur'an which was very similar to Surat Al-Tawba, Surat Bara'a [9] in
                    terms of its size and its very strong tone towards the disbelievers. Abu Musa says, we forgot this
                    verse. I forgot this chapter. I completely forgot this chapter. I only remember one verse from it,
                    and
                    he even mentions the verse. Basically the verse States that if the Bani Adam had two valleys of
                    money,
                    he would seek a third valley and nothing fulfills him except dust. Abu Musa Al-Ashari, in Sahih
                    Muslim
                    claims that there was an entire chapter that contained this verse that went missing.</p>

                <p>One very striking narration in Musnad Ahmad Ibn Hanbal States that A'yisha claims the following. She
                    stated that there was a verse about stoning and the sucklings, ten sucklings specifically. And we
                    read
                    it at the time of the Prophet salla Allahu alayhi wa alih, and it was written on a sheet of paper.
                    It
                    was in the house of the Prophet salla Allahu alayhi wa alih. But when the Prophet salla Allahu
                    alayhi wa
                    alih, passed away, we became busy with his loss, with the funeral, and because we became busy, an
                    animal
                    came, a domestic animal, a domestic animal came and ate that sheet of paper. And so that part of the
                    Qur'an got lost. Therefore, we find these Hadiths in Sunni sources about Tahrif. It would be unfair
                    for
                    any Muslim from other schools of thought, to attack the Shi'as and the followers of Ahl al-Bayt of
                    Tahrif when you have all these Hadiths in your sources.</p>

                <p>If you find Hadiths in Al-Kafi or other books that indicate some parts of the Qur'an went missing,
                    our
                    response to that is most scholars have not accepted that. So this should not be a sectarian issue.
                </p>

                <p>You have scholars from both sides, Sunni before, Shi'a, Sunni and Shi'a who have accepted some of
                    these
                    reports, and you have the majority of scholars, on both sides, who have rejected these reports. It's
                    not
                    a sectarian issue, it's a Muslim issue. And everyone must understand this point. Otherwise we're
                    being
                    biased and we're not being objective.</p>

                <p>There is a Hadith in the book of Kafi, attributed to Al-Imam as-Sadiq, alayhi as-salam, that states
                    the
                    Qur'an when it was revealed, it was revealed in 17000 verses. So now you have others who will attack
                    us.
                    Okay, so you Shii's are claiming two thirds of the Qur'an has been lost. When we analyze this Hadith
                    in
                    the book of Kafi, we have found some earlier versions of Al-Kafi. In those earlier versions which
                    were
                    closer to the era of Al-Kulayni [author of the book] we find that it mentioned 7000. The Imam says
                    the
                    Qur'an was revealed in 7000 verses. So the current version that is widely circulated, we find that
                    the
                    source for this version, the scribe made a mistake between 17000 and 7000.</p>

                <p>Some of these scribes were not educated. They did not know even what they were scribing. They just
                    were
                    able to scribe. So this is a mistake in the scribing. Otherwise, if you look at earlier sources of
                    Al-Kafi, it says 7000. Now someone will say, well, today you have 6236 verses. 7000? It's still more
                    than that. The Imam alayhi as-salam is rounding here. The Imam is just giving you an idea of how big
                    the
                    Holy Qur'an. It's about 7000 verses. This was a common Arabic way to indicate the length or the size
                    of
                    something.</p>
                <img src="..\Images\Holy_Quran_4.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Holy_Quran Image">
                <p>There is a verse on the Holy Qur'an that many have cited to negate Tahrif. &quot;Inna Nahnu nazalna
                    Adh-Dhikra, wa innahu la hafidhun&quot; (15:9). Allah says, &quot;We have revealed the Dhikr, which
                    is
                    the Holy Qur'an, the Remembrance, and We are protecting it, We shall protect it&quot;. Some people
                    will
                    say the fact that Allah, Subhana wa Ta'ala, is promising to protect the Qur'an negates any claims of
                    Tahrif. Most scholars have accepted this argument. Now, some scholars who have not accepted this
                    argument, what is their counter argument?</p>

                <p>They have said that, look, in the end, changes have happened to the Qur'an. Don't we have seven
                    Qira'at?
                    Sunni schools of thought recognize that you have seven Qira'at. And in some of those pronunciations,
                    versions, Qira'at, an entire word is replaced by another word or a word is in a different form, it's
                    in
                    a different weight. Well, that's a change in the Qur'an. So their counter argument is well, did
                    Allah
                    protect the Qur'an or no? Muslims historically have read the Qur'an slightly differently. And that
                    is a
                    type of Tahrif. It's not the same exact way that the Prophet read it. Some changes happen to it. So
                    then
                    where did Allah protect it?</p>

                <p>Those scholars state Allah did protect it in the copy of Imam Ali, alayhi as-salam. And every Imam of
                    Ahl
                    ul-Bayt had access to that copy. And today that copy is with our 12th Imam, Al-Imam Al-Mahdi, ajal
                    Allahu Ta'ala farajah. So Allah did protect the Qur'an, yes. Maybe a lot of people don't have access
                    to
                    it, or some people mispronounce certain words, but that doesn't mean that no changes have happened.
                    No,
                    some changes have happened. So when we say Allah protects the Qur'an, that means in the end, the
                    common
                    version, the mainstream version which the Imams of Ahl ul-Bayt, approved. Some variations might
                    happen
                    here or there. But Allah in the end did protect the Qur'an.</p>

                <p>During the nights of Qadr, in the Holy month of Ramadan, we reflect on the Holy Qur'an and those who
                    embodied it. It was on the 21st of Ramadan that Imam Ali alayhi as-salam, returned to his Lord. He
                    who
                    was referred to as the walking Qur'an, and to Shi'a muslims all around the world is the gate to the
                    vast
                    city of knowledge of the Holy Prophet, p&egrave;eace be upon him. As we reflect on the greatness of
                    the
                    Divine Book, we also reflect on the characters of the Holy Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and
                    his
                    successor, Ali ibn Abi Talib.</p>

                <p>Imam alayhi as-salam, the embodiment of the Holy Qur'an, the manifestation of the Qur'an, the Qur'an
                    an-natiq [speaking Qur'an] himself, left this world, the night the Qur'an was revealed, on the night
                    of
                    destiny. And the Imam, protected the Qur'an in ways we haven't truly appreciated. The Imam carried
                    on
                    the vision of the Holy Prophet of Islam. And the Prophet's vision was the preservation and the
                    veneration of the Qur'an itself. We noticed the Prophet would work tirelessly to motivate society to
                    memorize the Qur'an, to teach society how to read and write. He would say- War captives are free
                    from
                    war, if they can teach our children how to read and write, and if they can teach ten of them
                    specifically.</p>

                <p>Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib carried the same vision. He was a walking library in Kufa. He would approach
                    young
                    children and educate them. He would approach the elderly as well and inspire them. And so the Imam
                    alayhi as-salam, is truly underappreciated. You cannot have the Qur'an independent from the Imams of
                    Ahlul Bayt, the family of the Holy Prophet of Islam. This is the written Qur'an and they are the
                    walking, speaking Qur'an. And if you do not have a Qur'an that can speak on behalf of the written
                    version of the Qur'an, you will end up with extremism. You will end up with violence. You will end
                    up
                    with nonsensical theological opinions. When you merge them, they literally take you to the sky and
                    they
                    bring you to the heavens before you even met the heavens.</p>
                <img src="..\Images\Holy_Quran_5.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Holy_Quran Image">
                <p>Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib, alayhi as-salam, was the foremost defender of the Holy Qur'an. The Prophet
                    salla
                    Allahu alayhi wa alih, in 'sahih' Hadiths informed Imam Ali, of his task after him. The Prophet
                    tells
                    him, O' Ali, I will fight on Tanzil. Tanzil is the revelation of Qur'an. My struggle was to bring
                    the
                    Qur'an to the people. Your fight will be the fight of Ta'wil. You will struggle to preserve the
                    correct
                    meaning of the Qur'an. At the time of Imam Ali, alayhi as-salam, even when he was caliph for four
                    years,
                    people memorized the Qur'an. Many thousands of people, maybe hundreds of thousands of people, had
                    memorized the Qur'an.</p>

                <p>But there was a shallow understanding of the Qur'an. People were inserting their opinions into the
                    Holy
                    Qur'an. People were moving away from the actual meanings the Prophet preached. The one who brought
                    back
                    the Qur'an to its original meaning, the way that the Prophet salla Allahu alayhi wa alih, had
                    preached
                    it was none other than Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib. He truly preserved the meanings of the Qur'an. That's
                    why
                    when you read Nahj ul-Balagha for instance. Nahjul Blagha is just an application of the Holy Qur'an.
                    For
                    many of the sermons, you find the Imam citing verses, explaining to us what the verses mean, the
                    proper
                    understanding of the Qur'anic perspective.</p>

                <p>So indeed, Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib alayhi as-salam was the walking, talking Qur'an. When no one knew
                    the
                    meaning of some verses, Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib, alayhi as-salam, was always there to explain the
                    verses
                    of the Qur'an. At the time of 'Umar ibn Al-Khattab, this happened very frequently. People would come
                    to
                    'Umar ibn Al-Khattab, they would challenge him. There is a problem in this verse. There is a
                    contradiction between these verses. He would say, I don't know. I don't have access to that
                    knowledge.
                    Who would he call upon? Imam Ali alayhi as-salam!</p>

                <p>Abu Al-Hasan alayhi as-salam, come! Solve this problem for us. Everyone knew the relationship Imam
                    Ali
                    ibn Abi Talib, alayhi as-salam, had with the Holy Qur'an. He carried the Qur'an in his heart. He
                    lived
                    by the standards of the Qur'an. He was the walking, talking Qur'an, who knew the inner layers of the
                    Qur'an, the applications of the Holy Qur'an.</p>

                <p>So truly the one who preserved for us the Holy Qur'an, after the Prophet salla Allahu alayhi wa alih,
                    is
                    Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib alayhi as-salam! Especially when you come to the authentic, original meaning
                    of
                    the Holy Qur'an. And so, on Laylat ul-Qadr, thank Amir Al-Mu'minin, alayhi as-salam, for his
                    sacrifices.
                    Thank him for his efforts.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Glossary of Terms</h2>

            <p><strong>Holy Qur'an:</strong> The sacred text of Islam, believed to be the literal word of God (Allah) as
                revealed to the
                Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) over a period of approximately 23 years. It serves as the primary source of
                Islamic theology, law, and guidance for over a billion Muslims worldwide.</p>

            <p><strong>Revelation: </strong> The process through which divine messages were communicated to the Prophet
                Muhammad (PBUH) by
                God. This occurred through various mediums, including the Angel Gabriel, dreams, and direct inspiration,
                culminating in the verses of the Holy Qur'an that Muslims read today.</p>

            <p><strong>Lawh al-Mahfuz:</strong> Often referred to as the &quot;Preserved Tablet,&quot; this concept in
                Islamic theology
                denotes a celestial record where all divine knowledge and decrees are kept. Scholars debate whether the
                Qur'an existed in this form before its revelation to the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).</p>

            <p><strong>Mu'tazila: </strong> An Islamic theological school that emerged in the early centuries of Islam,
                known for its
                rationalist approach. The Mu'tazila argued that the Qur'an is created and not eternal, emphasizing the
                distinction between the Creator (Allah) and His creations, including the Qur'an.</p>

            <p><strong>Ahl ul-Bayt: </strong> Referring to the &quot;People of the House,&quot; this term encompasses
                the family of the
                Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), including his daughter Fatimah, cousin Ali, and their descendants. The Ahl
                ul-Bayt hold significant theological authority in Islam, particularly among Shia Muslims, who regard
                them as key interpreters of the Qur'an and its teachings.</p>

            <p><strong>Wahi (Revelation): </strong> The term &quot;Wahi&quot; refers to the divine communication or
                revelation from Allah
                to the Prophets. In the context of Islam, it especially pertains to the messages delivered to the
                Prophet Muhammad (salla Allahu alayhi wa alih) through the Archangel Gabriel (Jibra'il). Wahi can occur
                in various forms, including verbal communication, direct inspiration to the heart, and through dreams.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Tanzil (Gradual Revelation):</strong> &quot;Tanzil&quot; denotes the gradual process of
                revelation of the Qur'an
                over a span of 23 years. This method involved the sequential disclosure of verses in response to
                specific events, questions, or circumstances faced by the early Muslim community. Each verse was
                revealed in a context that enriched its understanding and application.</p>

            <p><strong>Maba'th: </strong> The term &quot;Maba'th&quot; refers to the event marking the commencement of
                the Prophet
                Muhammad's mission as the final messenger of Islam. It is traditionally commemorated on the 27th of
                Rajab, when the first verses of the Qur'an were revealed to the Prophet, signifying the beginning of his
                prophetic role and the spread of Islam.</p>

            <p><strong>Inzal (Sudden Revelation):</strong> &quot;Inzal&quot; describes the concept of sudden revelation,
                which occurs
                without prior warning, often in significant moments. In Islamic tradition, this form of revelation is
                particularly noted during Laylat al-Qadr (the Night of Decree), when it is believed that the entire
                Qur'an was revealed to the heart of the Prophet Muhammad at once.</p>

            <p><strong>Kitab (Book): </strong> The term &quot;Kitab&quot; means &quot;book&quot; in Arabic and is
                frequently used in the
                Qur'an to refer to itself, affirming its status as a written text. During the time of the Prophet
                Muhammad, the Qur'an existed primarily in oral form, but many companions understood its eventual
                compilation into a physical book, which reflects the Quran's significance as both a spiritual guide and
                a tangible scripture for the Muslim community.</p>

            <p><strong>Qira'at: </strong> Refers to the various accepted readings or recitations of the Qur'an, which
                differ in
                pronunciation, word forms, and sometimes meanings. There are seven primary Qira'at recognized in Sunni
                traditions, each with its own unique characteristics.</p>

            <p><strong>Tahrif:</strong> A term used to describe alterations or changes made to a text. In the context of
                the Qur'an, it
                refers to the notion that certain variations in recitation or interpretation may represent changes from
                the original revelation.</p>

            <p><strong>Nahj ul-Balagha:</strong> A collection of sermons, letters, and sayings attributed to Imam Ali
                ibn Abi Talib,
                showcasing his eloquence and deep understanding of the Qur'an. It serves as a significant source of
                Islamic philosophy and ethics.</p>

            <p><strong>Laylat ul-Qadr:</strong> Known as the Night of Decree or Power, it is considered one of the
                holiest nights in the
                Islamic calendar, occurring during the last ten days of Ramadan. Muslims believe it to be the night when
                the Qur'an was first revealed to the Prophet Muhammad, making it a time for reflection and devotion.</p>

                            The Holy Qur'an was revealed to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) over a period of 23
                            years. The revelations began in the Cave of Hira, near Mecca, where the Angel Jibreel
                            appeared to the Prophet and delivered the first verses. The process continued throughout the
                            Prophet’s life, addressing various events, questions, and guidance for the Muslim community.
