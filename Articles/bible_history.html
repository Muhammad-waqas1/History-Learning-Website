            <p>Bible, the sacred scriptures of Judaism and Christianity. The Christian Bible consists of the Old
                Testament and the New Testament, with the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox versions of the Old
                Testament being slightly larger because of their acceptance of certain books and parts of books
                considered apocryphal by Protestants. The Hebrew Bible includes only books known to Christians as the
                Old Testament. The arrangements of the Jewish and Christian canons differ considerably. The Protestant
                and Roman Catholic arrangements more nearly match one another.</p>

            <p>A brief treatment of the Bible follows. For full treatment, see biblical literature.</p>

                scriptures into three parts: the Torah (the &ldquo;Law,&rdquo; or Pentateuch), the Nevi&#702;im
                (&ldquo;Prophets&rdquo;), and the Ketuvim (&ldquo;Writings,&rdquo; or Hagiographa). The Pentateuch,
                together with the Book of Joshua (hence the name Hexateuch), can be seen as the account of how the
                Israelites became a nation and of how they possessed the Promised Land. The division designated as the
                &ldquo;Prophets&rdquo; continues the story of Israel in the Promised Land, describing the establishment
                and development of the monarchy and presenting the messages of the prophets to the people. The
                &ldquo;Writings&rdquo; include speculation on the place of evil and death in the scheme of things (Job
                and Ecclesiastes), the poetical works, and some additional historical books.</p>

                Testament, various types of literature are represented; the purpose of the Apocrypha seems to have been
                to fill in some of the gaps left by the indisputably canonical books and to carry the history of Israel

                vernacular. The New Testament is by far the shorter portion of the Christian Bible, but, through its
                associations with the spread of Christianity, it has wielded an influence far out of proportion to its
                modest size. Like the Old Testament, the New Testament is a collection of books, including a variety of
                early Christian literature. The four Gospels deal with the life, the person, and the teachings of Jesus,
                as he was remembered by the Christian community. The Acts of the Apostles carries the story of
                Christianity from the Resurrection of Jesus to the end of the career of St. Paul. The various Letters,
                or Epistles, are correspondence by various leaders of the early Christian church, chief among them St.
                Paul, applying the message of the church to the sundry needs and problems of early Christian
                congregations. The Book of Revelation (the Apocalypse) is the only canonical representative of a large
                genre of apocalyptic literature that appeared in the early Christian movement.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Glossary of Terms</h2>

            <p><strong>Old Testament:</strong> The first part of the Christian Bible, which corresponds to the Hebrew
                Bible and contains
                texts sacred in both Judaism and Christianity. It includes historical narratives, laws, poetry, and
                prophetic writings. The Old Testament is divided into various books, with differences in content and
                arrangement between Jewish, Protestant, and Catholic canons.</p>

            <p><strong>New Testament:</strong> The second part of the Christian Bible, consisting of texts that detail
                the life,
                teachings, and works of Jesus Christ, as well as the early Christian church. Key components include the
                four Gospels, the Acts of the Apostles, the Epistles (letters), and the Book of Revelation. It serves as
                a foundational text for Christian beliefs and practices.</p>

            <p><strong>Apocrypha: </strong>A collection of ancient texts that are included in some versions of the Old
                Testament but are
                considered non-canonical or apocryphal by Protestant denominations. These texts often aim to fill gaps
                in the biblical narrative and provide additional historical context regarding Israel's history.</p>

            <p><strong>Canon: </strong>The officially recognized collection of books that constitute the Bible for a
                particular religious
                tradition. The arrangement and selection of these texts differ among Judaism, Protestantism, Roman
                Catholicism, and Eastern Orthodoxy, leading to variations in the biblical canon across these faiths.</p>

            <p><strong>Pentateuch: </strong>The first five books of the Hebrew Bible, also known as the Torah. It
                includes Genesis,
                Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, and outlines the laws, creation stories, and covenant
                between God and the Israelites, serving as a foundational element of both Jewish and Christian
                scriptures.</p>

                            The Bible contains the sacred scriptures of Judaism and Christianity and has long been the
                            most available, familiar, and dependable source and arbiter of intellectual, moral, and
                            spiritual ideals in the West. The great biblical themes are God, his revealed works of
                            creation, provision, judgment, and deliverance, his covenant, and his promises. The Bible
                            sees what happens to humankind in the light of God’s nature, righteousness, faithfulness,
                            mercy, and love.

                            The Hebrew Bible was written in Hebrew. Its Greek translation, the Septuagint, made it
                            accessible in the Hellenistic period (c. 300 BCE–c. 300 CE) and provided a language for the
                            New Testament and for the Christian liturgy and theology of the first three centuries CE.
                            The Bible in Latin, the Vulgate, shaped the thought and life of Western people for a
                            thousand years. Bible translation led to the study and literary development of many
                            languages.

                            The Hebrew Bible has three divisions: Torah (Instruction, or Law; also called the
                            Pentateuch), Neviʾim (Prophets), and Ketuvim (Writings). These books are known to Christians
                            as the Old Testament. The Christian Bible consists of the Old Testament and the New
                            Testament. In the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions, the Old Testament includes
                            writings considered apocryphal by Protestants. The New Testament contains four Gospels
                            (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John), Acts, 21 letters, and Revelation.
