            <h3>Ancient Civilizations</h3>
            <h4>Prehistoric and Early Civilizations</h4>
            <p>In prehistoric times, healthcare practices were rudimentary and based on trial and error. One of the
                earliest known surgical procedures was trepanation, which involved drilling a hole into the skull to
                treat head injuries or mental health issues. Prehistoric people also used herbal medicine, utilizing
                plants for medicinal purposes. Evidence of these practices can be found in fossil records and cave
                paintings.</p>
            <h4>Mesopotamia and Egypt</h4>
            <p>The civilizations of Mesopotamia and Egypt made significant contributions to healthcare. In Mesopotamia,
                the Sumerians and Babylonians used opium for pain relief. Meanwhile, the Egyptians were skilled in
                surgery and had an extensive understanding of anatomy, as evidenced by their mummification practices.
                The Ebers Papyrus, one of the oldest medical texts, provides detailed information on various treatments
                and diagnoses used by the Egyptians.</p>
            <img src="..\Images\Health_1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="healthcare Image">
            <h3>Classical Antiquity</h3>
            <h4>Ancient Greece</h4>
            <p>Ancient Greece was a pivotal period for healthcare. Hippocrates, often referred to as the &ldquo;Father
                of Medicine,&rdquo; emphasized the importance of observation and diagnosis. He introduced the Four
                Humors Theory, suggesting that human health was maintained by a balance of four bodily fluids: blood,
                phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. The Hippocratic Oath, a set of ethical guidelines for physicians,
                remains relevant to this day.</p>
            <h4>Ancient Rome</h4>
            <p>In Ancient Rome, Galen's extensive writings dominated medical knowledge for centuries. He performed
                animal dissections to understand anatomy and developed theories on the circulatory and nervous systems.
                The Romans also made significant public health advancements by building aqueducts, public baths, and
                sewage systems, which greatly improved public health.</p>
            <h3>The Middle Ages</h3>
            <img src="..\Images\Health_5.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="healthcare Image">
            <h4>The Byzantine Empire</h4>
            <p>During the Byzantine Empire, medical knowledge from Greek and Roman sources was preserved and compiled
                into encyclopedic works by figures like Oribasius. This period saw the continuation and expansion of
                classical medical practices.</p>
            <h4>Islamic Golden Age</h4>
            <p>The Islamic Golden Age was a period of significant medical advancements. Avicenna, a prominent figure,
                wrote "The Canon of Medicine," which served as a medical authority for centuries. Islamic scholars
                translated and preserved Greek and Roman medical texts while adding their own contributions. Islamic
                hospitals, or bimaristans, were advanced institutions providing medical care, including surgeries and
                mental health treatments.</p>
            <h4>Medieval Europe</h4>
            <img src="..\Images\Health_2.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="healthcare Image">
            <p>In Medieval Europe, monasteries became centers of medical knowledge and practice. Monastic medicine
                involved growing medicinal herbs and providing care to the sick. The Black Death, a bubonic plague
                pandemic, devastated Europe and led to significant changes in medical practices and public health
                initiatives.</p>
            <h3>The Renaissance</h3>
            <h4>Rebirth of Science</h4>
            <p>The Renaissance marked a rebirth of scientific inquiry. Andreas Vesalius's work, "De Humani Corporis
                Fabrica," revolutionized the understanding of human anatomy through detailed illustrations based on
                dissections. Paracelsus challenged the traditional humoral theory, advocating for the use of chemicals
                in treatment and emphasizing the importance of observation and experimentation.</p>
            <h3>The Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution</h3>
            <h4>18th Century</h4>
            <p>During the 18th century, Edward Jenner developed the smallpox vaccine, laying the foundation for modern
                immunology. Marie Curie's discoveries in radiology contributed significantly to the diagnosis and
                treatment of diseases.</p>
            <h4>19th Century</h4>
            <img src="..\Images\Health_6.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="healthcare Image">
            <p>The 19th century witnessed groundbreaking advancements in medicine. Louis Pasteur's germ theory of
                disease transformed the understanding of infections, leading to advancements in sterilization and
                vaccines. Joseph Lister introduced antiseptic surgery, drastically reducing post-surgical infections.
                Florence Nightingale revolutionized nursing during the Crimean War by emphasizing hygiene and patient
                care.</p>
            <h3>The 20th Century</h3>
            <h4>Medical Advancements</h4>
            <p>The 20th century saw remarkable medical advancements. Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin
                revolutionized the treatment of bacterial infections. Vaccines for polio, measles, and other diseases
                significantly reduced mortality rates. The invention of X-rays, CT scans, and MRI allowed for
                non-invasive diagnosis of internal conditions.</p>
            <h4>Public Health Initiatives</h4>
            <img src="..\Images\Health_4.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="healthcare Image">
            <p>Public health initiatives became more prominent in the 20th century. The World Health Organization (WHO)
                was established in 1948 to promote global health, eradicate diseases, and respond to health crises.
                Various countries implemented universal healthcare systems to provide access to medical care for all
                citizens.</p>
            <h3>The 21st Century</h3>
            <h4>Technological Innovations</h4>
            <p>The 21st century has seen rapid technological advancements in healthcare. The Human Genome Project mapped
                the entire human genome, leading to significant progress in personalized medicine. Telemedicine, using
                digital technologies, has made healthcare more accessible, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.
                Artificial intelligence is being used for diagnostics, treatment planning, and predicting disease
                outbreaks.</p>
            <h4>Public Health Challenges</h4>
            <p>Despite technological advancements, the 21st century has faced significant public health challenges. The
                COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of global cooperation in health. There is an increased
                focus on preventing and managing chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.</p>
