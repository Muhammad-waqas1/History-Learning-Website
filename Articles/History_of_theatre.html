            <h3>The History of Theatre</h3>
            <p>Theatre, one of the oldest forms of storytelling and artistic expression, has a rich and varied history
                that spans thousands of years and cultures across the globe. It has served as a platform for
                entertainment, education, social commentary, and political discourse. The evolution of theatre reflects
                the changing values, beliefs, and technological advancements of human societies.</p>
            <h4>Origins of Theatre</h4>
            <p>The origins of theatre can be traced back to ancient rituals and religious ceremonies. Early forms of
                theatrical performance were closely linked to religious and cultural practices, where participants used
                dance, music, and storytelling to convey myths, legends, and communal values. These performances often
                took place during festivals and other significant events.</p>
            <p>One of the earliest known forms of theatre is the ancient Egyptian passion plays, which depicted the myth
                of Osiris. These performances, held as early as 2500 BCE, involved elaborate rituals and storytelling to
                honor the gods and celebrate the cycles of life and death.</p>

            <h4>Ancient Greek Theatre</h4>
            <p>Theatre as we know it today has its roots in ancient Greece. The Greeks are credited with developing many
                of the foundational elements of Western theatre, including the use of written scripts, dramatic
                structure, and theatrical conventions.</p>
            <p>Greek theatre emerged in the 6th century BCE in Athens during the festivals of Dionysus, the god of wine,
                fertility, and theatre. These festivals featured dramatic competitions where playwrights presented their
                works in the genres of tragedy and comedy. The plays were performed in open-air amphitheaters, with
                large audiences gathering to witness the performances.</p>
            <p>Notable playwrights of ancient Greek theatre include Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, who are
                renowned for their tragic dramas, and Aristophanes, who is celebrated for his comedic plays. Greek
                tragedies often explored themes of fate, morality, and the human condition, while comedies provided
                social and political satire.</p>
            <img src="..\Images\Theater2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Theatre Image">
            <h4>Roman Theatre</h4>
            <p>The Romans were greatly influenced by Greek theatre and adapted many of its conventions and styles. Roman
                theatre emerged in the 3rd century BCE and became an integral part of Roman culture and entertainment.
            </p>
            <p>Roman playwrights such as Plautus, Terence, and Seneca contributed to the development of Roman comedy and
                tragedy. Roman theatre was known for its grandeur and spectacle, often incorporating elaborate set
                designs, special effects, and large casts. The construction of permanent stone theatres, such as the
                Theatre of Pompey in Rome, provided venues for these performances.</p>
            <p>In addition to traditional plays, Roman theatre included other forms of entertainment, such as mime,
                pantomime, and gladiatorial contests. These diverse forms of performance catered to the tastes and
                preferences of Roman audiences.</p>
            <img src="..\Images\Theater3.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Theatre Image">
            <h4>Medieval Theatre</h4>
            <p>With the decline of the Roman Empire, European theatre experienced a period of dormancy. However, theatre
                reemerged during the medieval period, closely tied to the Christian church and religious practices.</p>
            <p>Medieval theatre initially took the form of liturgical dramas, which were performed within churches and
                depicted biblical stories and saints' lives. These dramas evolved into more elaborate mystery plays and
                miracle plays, which were performed by guilds and presented on pageant wagons during religious
                festivals.</p>
            <p>Morality plays, which emerged in the late medieval period, focused on allegorical stories that conveyed
                moral and ethical lessons. One of the most famous morality plays is "Everyman," which explores themes of
                life, death, and redemption.</p>
            <h4>The Renaissance and Elizabethan Theatre</h4>
            <p>The Renaissance, a period of cultural and artistic revival in Europe, brought significant advancements to
                theatre. The rediscovery of classical Greek and Roman texts inspired playwrights and performers to
                explore new forms of drama and storytelling.</p>
            <img src="..\Images\Theater4.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Theatre Image">
            <p>In England, the Elizabethan era (1558-1603) marked a golden age of theatre, with the rise of prominent
                playwrights such as William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe, and Ben Jonson. The construction of
                playhouses, such as the Globe Theatre in London, provided venues for the performance of plays that
                catered to diverse audiences.</p>
            <p>Shakespeare's contributions to theatre are unparalleled, with his plays encompassing a wide range of
                genres, including tragedies, comedies, histories, and romances. His works, such as "Hamlet," "Macbeth,"
                "A Midsummer Night's Dream," and "Romeo and Juliet," continue to be performed and studied worldwide.</p>
            <h4>The Enlightenment and Neoclassical Theatre</h4>
            <img src="..\Images\Theater5.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Theatre Image">
            <p>The Enlightenment, an intellectual movement of the 17th and 18th centuries, emphasized reason, science,
                and individualism. This period saw the development of neoclassical theatre, which adhered to strict
                rules of dramatic structure and emphasized clarity, order, and decorum.</p>
            <p>French playwrights such as Moli&egrave;re, Racine, and Corneille were prominent figures in neoclassical
                theatre. Moli&egrave;re, known for his comedies, such as "Tartuffe" and "The Misanthrope," satirized the
                social and cultural norms of his time. Racine and Corneille, known for their tragedies, drew inspiration
                from classical themes and emphasized emotional depth and moral conflict.</p>

            <h4>The 19th Century and Romantic Theatre</h4>
            <p>The 19th century was marked by the Romantic movement, which emphasized emotion, individualism, and the
                sublime. Romantic theatre rejected the strict rules of neoclassicism and embraced more flexible and
                imaginative forms of drama.</p>
            <img src="..\Images\Theater6.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Theatre Image">
            <p>Prominent playwrights of the Romantic period include Victor Hugo, known for his play "Hernani," and
                Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, known for "Faust." Romantic theatre often featured larger-than-life
                characters, dramatic landscapes, and themes of love, heroism, and the supernatural.</p>
            <p>The 19th century also saw the rise of realism and naturalism in theatre. Playwrights such as Henrik
                Ibsen, Anton Chekhov, and August Strindberg sought to depict everyday life and human behavior with
                greater accuracy and authenticity. Their works, such as Ibsen's "A Doll's House," Chekhov's "The Cherry
                Orchard," and Strindberg's "Miss Julie," addressed social issues, psychological complexities, and the
                struggles of ordinary people.</p>
            <h4>The 20th Century and Modern Theatre</h4>
            <p>The 20th century was a period of significant experimentation and innovation in theatre. Various movements
                and styles emerged, challenging traditional forms and exploring new ways of storytelling and
                performance.</p>
            <img src="..\Images\Theater7.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Theatre Image">
            <p>Expressionism, a movement that sought to convey the inner emotional experiences of characters, influenced
                playwrights such as Eugene O'Neill and Bertolt Brecht. Brecht's epic theatre, which aimed to provoke
                critical thinking and social change, introduced techniques such as the use of narration, minimal sets,
                and direct address to the audience.</p>
            <p>Theatre of the Absurd, led by playwrights such as Samuel Beckett, Eug&egrave;ne Ionesco, and Jean Genet,
                explored the absurdity and meaninglessness of human existence. Beckett's play "Waiting for Godot" is a
                seminal work of this movement, characterized by its minimalist setting and repetitive dialogue.</p>
            <p>In the latter half of the 20th century, postmodernism and experimental theatre further pushed the
                boundaries of traditional theatre. Playwrights such as Harold Pinter, Tom Stoppard, and Caryl Churchill
                explored themes of identity, language, and power through fragmented narratives, meta-theatrical
                techniques, and unconventional structures.</p>
            <img src="..\Images\Theater8.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Theatre Image">
            <h4>Contemporary Theatre</h4>
            <p>Today, theatre continues to be a vibrant and dynamic art form that reflects the diversity and complexity
                of contemporary society. Playwrights, directors, and performers continue to experiment with new forms
                and styles, addressing a wide range of themes and issues.</p>
            <p>Contemporary theatre encompasses a variety of genres, including drama, comedy, musical theatre, and
                immersive theatre. The rise of digital technology has also influenced theatre, with virtual and
                augmented reality experiences, multimedia productions, and live-streamed performances becoming more
                prevalent.</p>
            <p>Prominent contemporary playwrights include Tony Kushner, known for "Angels in America," a powerful
                exploration of the AIDS crisis and American society, and Lin-Manuel Miranda, known for the
                groundbreaking musical "Hamilton," which blends historical narrative with hip-hop and diverse casting.
