            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>The history of literature spans thousands of years, chronicling the evolution of human thought, culture,
                and creativity. It serves as a reflection of societies, capturing their dreams, struggles, and triumphs
                while preserving the legacy of intellectual and artistic expression. Literature, in its myriad forms,
                has been instrumental in shaping civilizations and connecting humanity across time and space.</p>
            <h4>The Beginnings: Oral Traditions and Early Writings</h4>
            <img src="..\Images\Literature_1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Literature Image">
            <p>The origins of literature lie in oral traditions, where stories, poems, and songs were passed down from
                one generation to the next. These oral narratives often revolved around myths, legends, and religious
                rituals, serving as both entertainment and moral instruction. The epics of ancient cultures, such as the
                Mahabharata, the Iliad, and the Odyssey, were originally transmitted orally before being committed to
                writing.</p>
            <p>The advent of writing systems marked a transformative moment in the history of literature. The earliest
                known written works date back to ancient Mesopotamia, with texts like the Epic of Gilgamesh inscribed on
                clay tablets. These texts not only preserved stories but also documented laws, philosophies, and
                histories. In ancient Egypt, hieroglyphs were used to create literary works such as "The Tale of
                Sinuhe," blending history and fiction to explore human dilemmas.</p>
            <h4>Classical Antiquity: Foundations of Western and Eastern Literatures</h4>
            <img src="..\Images\Literature_2.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="width: 250px;" alt="Literature Image">
            <p>In classical antiquity, literature flourished in both the Western and Eastern worlds. In ancient Greece,
                authors like Homer and Hesiod laid the foundations of Western literary tradition. Greek tragedy and
                comedy reached their zenith with playwrights such as Sophocles, Euripides, and Aristophanes.
                Philosophical writings by Plato and Aristotle also became cornerstones of intellectual thought.</p>
            <p>In ancient Rome, literary achievements were marked by works of poets such as Virgil, Horace, and Ovid.
                The Roman Empire&rsquo;s influence spread its literary culture far and wide, with the Aeneid by Virgil
                serving as a seminal epic that celebrated Roman values and heritage. Meanwhile, historical writings by
                authors like Livy and Tacitus offered detailed accounts of Roman society and governance.</p>
            <p>Eastern literature, during this period, flourished in regions such as India and China. Sanskrit texts,
                including the Vedas, Upanishads, and epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata, offered profound
                philosophical insights and artistic expression. In China, Confucian and Daoist texts shaped societal
                values, while poets like Li Bai and Du Fu enriched the literary canon with their evocative verses.</p>
            <h4>The Middle Ages: Religious Influence and Cultural Diversity</h4>
            <img src="..\Images\Literature_3.webp" class="img-fluid" alt="Literature Image">
            <p>The medieval period witnessed the dominance of religious literature, reflecting the spiritual
                preoccupations of the time. In Europe, Christianity inspired a wealth of theological and philosophical
                writings, including Saint Augustine&rsquo;s "Confessions" and Thomas Aquinas&rsquo; "Summa Theologica."
                Epic poetry, such as "Beowulf" and "The Song of Roland," celebrated heroism and valor, while courtly
                literature explored themes of love and chivalry.</p>
            <p>In the Islamic world, the Qur'an emerged as a literary masterpiece, influencing Arabic prose and poetry
                for centuries. Persian literature blossomed with poets like Rumi, Hafez, and Ferdowsi, whose "Shahnameh"
                remains an epic of unparalleled grandeur. Meanwhile, in East Asia, Japan&rsquo;s "Tale of Genji" by
                Murasaki Shikibu is often considered the world&rsquo;s first novel, offering an intimate portrayal of
                courtly life.</p>
            <h4>The Renaissance: Revival and Innovation</h4>
            <p>The Renaissance marked a rebirth of classical learning and an explosion of literary creativity. In
                Europe, this period saw the rise of humanism, emphasizing the dignity and potential of individuals.
                Writers like Dante Alighieri, Geoffrey Chaucer, and William Shakespeare produced works that blended
                classical influences with innovative storytelling.</p>
            <p>Dante&rsquo;s "Divine Comedy" offered a visionary journey through the afterlife, combining allegory with
                vivid imagery. Chaucer&rsquo;s "Canterbury Tales" depicted a tapestry of medieval society through the
                voices of diverse characters. Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays and sonnets explored the complexities of human
                emotions, solidifying his reputation as one of the greatest literary figures of all time.</p>
            <p>The Renaissance also witnessed the invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg, revolutionizing
                the dissemination of literature. Books became more accessible, fueling intellectual movements such as
                the Reformation and the Scientific Revolution.</p>
            <h4>The Enlightenment and Romanticism</h4>
            <img src="..\Images\Literature_4.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Literature Image">
            <p>The Enlightenment of the 17th and 18th centuries emphasized reason, progress, and individual rights.
                Literary works during this period often engaged with philosophical ideas, as seen in the writings of
                Voltaire, Rousseau, and John Locke. Satirical works like Jonathan Swift&rsquo;s "Gulliver&rsquo;s
                Travels" and Alexander Pope&rsquo;s "The Rape of the Lock" critiqued societal norms with wit and
                insight.</p>
            <p>In contrast, the Romantic movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries celebrated emotion,
                imagination, and nature. Romantic poets such as William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Percy
                Bysshe Shelley crafted verses that evoked profound emotional and spiritual experiences. Novelists like
                Mary Shelley and the Bront&euml; sisters explored Gothic themes and the depths of human psychology.</p>
            <h4>The Modern Era: Diversity and Experimentation</h4>
            <img src="..\Images\Literature_5.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Literature Image">
            <p>The 20th century ushered in an era of unprecedented literary diversity and experimentation. Modernist
                writers such as James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and T. S. Eliot broke with traditional forms, embracing
                stream-of-consciousness narratives and fragmented structures to capture the complexities of modern life.
                The Harlem Renaissance in the United States celebrated African American culture through the works of
                Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, and others.</p>
            <p>Postmodern literature further challenged conventions, blending genres and incorporating self-referential
                elements. Authors like Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez, Salman Rushdie, and Margaret Atwood
                explored themes of identity, power, and storytelling itself. Meanwhile, the rise of global literature
                highlighted voices from previously marginalized regions, fostering cross-cultural understanding.</p>
            <h4>Literature in the Digital Age</h4>
            <p>In the 21st century, literature continues to evolve in response to technological advancements. The
                digital age has transformed how literature is produced, distributed, and consumed. E-books, audiobooks,
                and online platforms have democratized access to literary works, while social media and digital
                storytelling have created new forms of narrative expression.</p>
            <p>Contemporary literature reflects the complexities of a globalized world, addressing issues such as
                climate change, migration, and social justice. Diverse voices and perspectives are increasingly
                celebrated, ensuring that literature remains a vibrant and dynamic force in human culture.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Glossary of Terms</h2>

            <p><strong>Oral Traditions:</strong> A form of storytelling that predates written literature, where
                narratives, poems, and songs are passed down verbally from one generation to another. These traditions
                often encompass myths, legends, and cultural rituals, serving both entertainment and moral instruction
                purposes.</p>
            <p><strong>Epic:</strong> A lengthy narrative poem that recounts the adventures and deeds of heroic figures
                or significant events within a culture. Notable examples include the "Iliad," "Odyssey," and
                "Mahabharata," which are foundational texts in their respective literary traditions.</p>
            <p><strong>Humanism:</strong> An intellectual movement that emerged during the Renaissance, emphasizing the
                value and agency of human beings, as well as the study of classical texts. Humanism influenced
                literature by promoting themes of individuality, reason, and the exploration of human experience.</p>
            <p><strong>Modernism:</strong> A literary movement that arose in the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
                characterized by a break with traditional forms and conventions. Modernist writers experimented with
                narrative techniques, such as stream-of-consciousness and fragmentation, to reflect the complexities of
                contemporary life.</p>
            <p><strong>Postmodernism:</strong> A late 20th-century literary movement that challenges established norms
                and conventions in literature. Postmodern works often blend genres, employ metafiction, and explore
                themes of identity and reality, reflecting the fragmented and diverse nature of contemporary society.
