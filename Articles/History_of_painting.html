            <h3>The History of Painting</h3>
            <p>Painting is one of the oldest and most universal forms of human expression. Its history spans thousands
                of years and encompasses a wide range of styles, techniques, and cultural contexts. From the earliest
                cave paintings to the masterpieces of the Renaissance, and from abstract modern art to contemporary
                digital creations, painting has continually evolved to reflect the changing beliefs, values, and
                experiences of societies around the world.</p>
            <h4>Prehistoric Painting</h4>
            <p>The origins of painting can be traced back to prehistoric times, when early humans created images on cave
                walls, rock shelters, and other surfaces. These early paintings, often referred to as cave art or rock
                art, date back to around 40,000 BCE and are found in various locations around the world.</p>
            <ul>
                <img src="..\Images\Painting1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Painting Image">
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Cave Paintings</strong>: Some of the most famous examples of prehistoric cave paintings
                        are found in the caves of Lascaux (France), Altamira (Spain), and Chauvet (France). These
                        paintings often depict animals such as bison, horses, and deer, as well as human figures and
                        abstract symbols. They were created using natural pigments such as ochre, charcoal, and
                        hematite.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Rock Art</strong>: In addition to cave paintings, prehistoric people also created rock
                        art on exposed rock surfaces. This form of painting is found in regions such as Africa,
                        Australia, and the Americas. Rock art includes petroglyphs (carved or engraved images) and
                        pictographs (painted images) and often features scenes of hunting, rituals, and everyday life.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Ancient Civilizations</h4>
            <p>As human societies became more complex and organized, painting evolved to reflect the cultural,
                religious, and social practices of ancient civilizations.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Ancient Egypt</strong>: Egyptian painting is characterized by its highly stylized and
                        symbolic representation of figures and scenes. Wall paintings in tombs and temples depicted
                        gods, pharaohs, and everyday life with an emphasis on order and hierarchy. The use of color was
                        significant, with specific colors symbolizing different aspects of life and the afterlife.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Ancient Greece and Rome</strong>: Greek and Roman painting was influenced by the
                        development of naturalism and realism. Greek vase painting, with its distinctive red-figure and
                        black-figure techniques, depicted mythological scenes and everyday activities. Roman wall
                        paintings, particularly those found in Pompeii and Herculaneum, showcased intricate frescoes
                        with detailed landscapes, portraits, and architectural elements.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Ancient China</strong>: Chinese painting has a long and continuous history, with early
                        examples dating back to the Shang Dynasty (1600-1046 BCE). Traditional Chinese painting often
                        depicted landscapes, nature, and scenes of everyday life. The use of ink and brush on silk or
                        paper became a hallmark of Chinese art, with a focus on calligraphy and the harmony between
                        humans and nature.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Medieval and Byzantine Painting</h4>
            <img src="..\Images\Painting2.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Painting Image">
            <p>The medieval period saw the development of distinct painting styles influenced by religious and cultural
                contexts.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Byzantine Art</strong>: Byzantine painting, which emerged in the Eastern Roman Empire, is
                        characterized by its religious themes and use of gold leaf. Icons, religious images painted on
                        wood, were central to Byzantine art and played a significant role in worship and devotion.
                        Mosaics, which used small pieces of colored glass or stone, were also a prominent feature of
                        Byzantine churches and basilicas.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Medieval European Art</strong>: In medieval Europe, painting was closely tied to
                        religious institutions and themes. Illuminated manuscripts, which featured elaborately decorated
                        pages, were created by monks and scribes to illustrate religious texts. Frescoes and panel
                        paintings adorned the walls and altars of churches, depicting biblical scenes and saints with a
                        focus on spirituality and symbolism.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>The Renaissance</h4>
            <p>The Renaissance, which began in Italy in the 14th century and spread across Europe, marked a period of
                significant cultural and artistic revival. Painting during the Renaissance was characterized by a
                renewed interest in classical antiquity, humanism, and naturalism.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Italian Renaissance</strong>: Italian painters such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo,
                        and Raphael made significant contributions to the development of Renaissance art. Their works
                        showcased a mastery of perspective, anatomy, and composition, resulting in lifelike and dynamic
                        images. The use of oil paint, which allowed for greater detail and depth of color, became
                        widespread during this period.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Northern Renaissance</strong>: In Northern Europe, artists such as Jan van Eyck, Albrecht
                        D&uuml;rer, and Hieronymus Bosch developed their unique styles and techniques. The Northern
                        Renaissance was characterized by meticulous attention to detail, vibrant colors, and the use of
                        symbolism. Van Eyck's pioneering use of oil paint and D&uuml;rer's detailed engravings exemplify
                        the achievements of this period.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Baroque and Rococo</h4>
            <img src="..\Images\Painting3.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Painting Image">
            <p>The Baroque period, which began in the late 16th century, was marked by dramatic compositions, dynamic
                movement, and emotional intensity. This style was followed by the Rococo period, which emerged in the
                early 18th century and emphasized elegance, playfulness, and ornate decoration.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Baroque Art</strong>: Baroque painters such as Caravaggio, Peter Paul Rubens, and
                        Rembrandt created works that conveyed dramatic narratives and intense emotions. The use of
                        chiaroscuro, a technique that contrasts light and shadow, enhanced the sense of depth and
                        realism. Baroque art often depicted religious, mythological, and historical subjects with a
                        focus on grandeur and movement.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Rococo Art</strong>: Rococo painting, exemplified by artists such as Jean-Antoine
                        Watteau, Fran&ccedil;ois Boucher, and Jean-Honor&eacute; Fragonard, embraced a lighter and more
                        decorative style. Rococo works often depicted scenes of romance, leisure, and fantasy, with a
                        focus on delicate colors, intricate details, and playful compositions.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Neoclassicism and Romanticism</h4>
            <p>The late 18th and early 19th centuries saw the emergence of Neoclassicism and Romanticism, two
                contrasting artistic movements that responded to the cultural and political changes of the time.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Neoclassicism</strong>: Neoclassical painters such as Jacques-Louis David and
                        Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres sought to revive the ideals of classical antiquity, emphasizing
                        order, harmony, and rationality. Neoclassical art often depicted historical and mythological
                        subjects with a focus on idealized forms and precise technique.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Romanticism</strong>: In contrast to Neoclassicism, Romanticism emphasized emotion,
                        individualism, and the sublime. Romantic painters such as Francisco Goya, Caspar David
                        Friedrich, and J.M.W. Turner created works that explored the power of nature, the mysteries of
                        the human psyche, and the heroism of the individual. Their use of dramatic lighting, vivid
                        colors, and expressive brushwork conveyed a sense of awe and wonder.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>The 19th Century and Early 20th Century</h4>
            <p>The 19th and early 20th centuries were marked by a series of artistic movements that challenged
                traditional conventions and explored new forms of expression.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <img src="..\Images\Painting4.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Painting Image">
                    <p><strong>Realism</strong>: Realist painters such as Gustave Courbet and Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois
                        Millet sought to depict everyday life and social realities with honesty and accuracy. Realism
                        rejected the idealization and romanticism of earlier movements, focusing instead on the ordinary
                        and often harsh aspects of human existence.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Impressionism</strong>: Impressionist painters such as Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste
                        Renoir, and Edgar Degas revolutionized the art world with their innovative techniques and focus
                        on capturing the fleeting effects of light and color. Impressionism emphasized spontaneity,
                        loose brushwork, and outdoor scenes, often depicting landscapes, cityscapes, and everyday
                        activities.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Post-Impressionism</strong>: Post-Impressionist painters such as Vincent van Gogh, Paul
                        C&eacute;zanne, and Georges Seurat built upon the innovations of Impressionism while exploring
                        new ways of representing form and color. Their works often featured bold colors, distinct
                        brushstrokes, and a focus on emotional expression and structural composition.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Symbolism</strong>: Symbolist painters such as Gustav Klimt, Odilon Redon, and Gustave
                        Moreau explored themes of mythology, dreams, and the inner world of the imagination. Symbolism
                        rejected realism in favor of mystical and allegorical imagery, often using vibrant colors and
                        intricate patterns.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Fauvism and Expressionism</strong>: Fauvist painters such as Henri Matisse and
                        Andr&eacute; Derain emphasized bold, non-naturalistic colors and simplified forms to convey
                        emotional impact. Expressionist painters such as Edvard Munch and Wassily Kandinsky sought to
                        express inner emotions and psychological states through distorted forms, intense colors, and
                        dynamic compositions.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Modern and Contemporary Painting</h4>
            <img src="..\Images\Painting5.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Painting Image">
            <p>The 20th century brought about a radical transformation in painting, with artists experimenting with new
                styles, techniques, and concepts.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Cubism</strong>: Developed by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, Cubism broke away from
                        traditional perspective and representation. Cubist paintings fragmented objects into geometric
                        shapes and explored multiple viewpoints simultaneously. This movement laid the groundwork for
                        abstract art and challenged conventional</p>
